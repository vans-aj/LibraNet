Yuval Noah Harari,Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,50,978-0062316097,"Anthropology, World History","Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari is a sweeping exploration of human history, from the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa around 300,000 years ago to the present day. Harari divides history into four major revolutions that shaped human society: the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, the Unification of Humankind, and the Scientific Revolution. The Cognitive Revolution (around 70,000 years ago) marks the point when humans began to develop complex language, imagination, and shared myths, enabling large-scale cooperation. The Agricultural Revolution (about 12,000 years ago) shifted societies from hunting and gathering to farming, leading to population growth, social hierarchies, and the rise of kingdoms and empires. The Unification of Humankind explores how cultures, trade, religion, and empires gradually brought different human groups together. Harari then examines the Scientific Revolution (starting around 500 years ago), which sparked massive advances in knowledge, technology, capitalism, and human control over the environment. Harari questions widely accepted ideas such as happiness, progress, and the cost of civilization. He argues that while humans have gained power and control, it hasn’t necessarily made us happier or more fulfilled.",https://share.google/images/TxzlPS3VD5r7LqP5g
Stephen Hawking,A Brief History of Time,15,978-0553380163,"Cosmology, Physics","A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking is a landmark book that introduces complex concepts of cosmology to general readers. Published in 1988, it explores the nature, origin, and fate of the universe through clear explanations of physics and astronomy. Hawking begins by discussing classical ideas of the universe, including Newton’s laws and Einstein’s theory of relativity, which describe how objects move and how space and time are connected. He then delves into quantum mechanics, the science of the very small, explaining how particles behave unpredictably at tiny scales. Central to the book is the concept of black holes—regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape. Hawking famously theorizes that black holes aren’t entirely “black” but emit radiation, now called Hawking radiation, leading them to slowly evaporate. The book also tackles profound questions: How did the universe begin? What is time? Does the universe have a boundary or an edge? Hawking discusses the Big Bang theory as the starting point of the universe and explores ideas about whether the universe is infinite or finite. Throughout, Hawking explores the quest for a unified theory—a 'Theory of Everything' that would combine gravity with quantum physics, explaining all forces of nature in a single framework. A Brief History of Time is notable for making cutting-edge scientific ideas accessible, blending rigorous science with philosophical reflection. It invites readers to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and humanity’s place within it.",https://share.google/images/rOmEBu2DuNcoW0NEG
James Clear,Atomic Habits,60,978-0735211292,"Psychology, Self-Improvement","Atomic Habits by James Clear is a practical guide to building good habits and breaking bad ones by focusing on small, consistent changes. Clear argues that tiny improvements—just 1% better each day—compound over time to produce remarkable results. The book centers on the idea that habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Clear introduces a four-step framework for habit formation: Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward. By understanding these stages, readers can design habits that stick. Clear emphasizes the importance of making habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying to create lasting change. He also explains how environment shapes behavior and why focusing on systems and identity (who you want to become) is more effective than focusing solely on goals. Through engaging stories and scientific research, Atomic Habits teaches readers how to overcome procrastination, break negative patterns, and build routines that lead to success. The book’s core message is that real change comes from small actions repeated consistently, making transformation accessible to anyone willing to start. Ultimately, Atomic Habits is a roadmap for unlocking potential by mastering the habits that define our daily lives.",https://share.google/images/2ge6Z6NBrvKC5kFkw
